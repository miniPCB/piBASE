This is a test.

Let piBASE be a safe place for junk to accumulate. Software objects of no obvious value. Their only reason for existing being that they were created. By a thing and a process.

We can ignore both the thing and the process. We can waste resources thinking about the thing and the process. We can create elaborate stories about the thing and the process. It's a free country, folks. We can even use it to create a system where we give an emotional experience and we receive everything we want and need.

We won't be the first and, even if we don't, we won't be the last.

So then, what shall we do with errors occurring in a pile of software junk? Maybe we leave them where we found them and do our best inspite of their existence in space and time?
